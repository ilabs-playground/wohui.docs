**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** uses "Snowballing."

"Snowballing" means that texts are composed exclusively of words the learner already knows.  The more words the learner know, the more complex the texts can be.  Because the words are all known, the learner can focus their attention on the text rather than on its component parts.

To maximise the number of snowballed texts that are accessible to learners at each stage, words need to be learned in order of usefulness - that is, primarily, in order of frequency of occurrence.

This approach is especially well-suited to Mandarin Chinese because all texts comprise equal-sized building blocks (written characters or spoken syllables) which can be re-arranged without modification or additions. For example:

- With 孩子 you can talk about both one "child" and many where in English you must add the new word "children"
- With one block 去 you can say "to go", "go", "goes", "am going", "are going", "is going", "has gone", "have gone" etc.
- With 我看你 (I watch you) you can also say 你看我 (you watch me) where in English you must add the new word "me"

Snowballing enables the learner to do more with the words they know.  In Chinese, it is exponentially more.

Again, this is in many ways a re-discovery of a traditional Chinese methodology lost in the deluge of Western educational models. The 千字文 (Thousand Character Classic), for example, is a text written in 5th century using the most common 1000 characters at the time and using each one only once.  The 千字文 was a primer for Chinese language learners for centuries.

**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** has been particularly inspired and informed by Joël Marc Bellassen (白乐桑) and his pioneering work in the French education system over many decades.
