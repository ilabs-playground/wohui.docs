**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** uses "Scaffolding."

"Scaffolding" means allowing the learner to focus on one new thing at a time, ideally within the context of their final goal.  For example, scaffolding is ...
- holding the saddle of a bike so that a child can actually ride without having to think about balancing whilst they are working on pedalling
- snorkelling above a new scuba diver so they can actually dive without having to think about air pressure whilst they are working on breathing
- placing your arm under a young gymnast's back so they can actually back-flip without having to think about how high they jump whilst they are working on flipping their legs over their head

Scaffolding involves separating out the various different tasks that ultimately need to be carried out simultaneously.  For **我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** this begins with treating spoken and written Chinese as two parallel languages rather than one. Unlike with Indo-European languages, being able to speak does not mean you can write, nor vice versa.  While "Hello" may be the most useful word to learn first in spoken Chinese; "China" may be the most useful word to learn first in written Chinese.

Being able to understand a spoken word does not necessarily mean you can say it yourself; being able to understand a written word does not necessarily mean you can write it yourself.  There is a journey to undertake between listening and speaking, and between reading and writing.

Even with listening, for example, there is a range of tasks involved in learning a new word, including:
- discerning the sound of the spoken word
- identifying the sound in the context of other sounds (eg. in a sentence)
- identifying the tone (which English speakers have been trained to ignore)
- transcribing the sound including its tone (use Pinyin, eg. to look the new word up in a dictionary)
- understanding what that sound represents (the general meaning of the word)
- understanding what that sound represents in context (the specific meaning of the word)

**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** provides scaffolding to the learner directly through the way course material is organised and delivered, and facilitates a scaffolded approach from other contributors such as teachers and writers.
