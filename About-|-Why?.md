The world has changed:
- **China**'s re-emergence means the global political and economic environment is no longer exclusively dominated by an Anglophone Western mindset.  This calls for a new way of thinking.
- **Globalisation** has made us interdependent on people in other worlds.  This calls for a new depth of interpersonal engagement.
- **Technology** has transformed the way we learn and the jobs we do.  This calls for a new model for schools and teachers.

**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** is a response to this three-fold call.

Mandarin as a foreign language is a young subject.  As a result, it has so far generally adopted methods poorly suited to the task because they were developed for a:
- Different type of language (Indo-European)
- Different type of learner (native Chinese children)
- Different type of platform (publication).  

**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** has re-envisioned the way Mandarin as a foreign language is taught given that:
- Chinese is not just another language: it's a different type of language
- Older and non-native language learners have different needs to infants and natives
- Digital technology enables different kinds of interaction with the language

**我会 | MANDARIN CHINESE** addresses each of these primarily through:
- Snowballing
- Scaffolding
- Flipped
