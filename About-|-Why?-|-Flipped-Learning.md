"Flipped Learning" means that students acquire the new information BEFORE the lesson and put it to use under the teacher's direction DURING the lesson ...

... as opposed to the "Traditional" model that we have become used to in schools, where the teacher transfers new information to the students DURING the lesson and the students put it to use in practice exercises AFTER the lesson.

Let’s look at where flipped learning has come from.

Many credit Bergmann and Sams, 2 science teachers at Woodland Park High School in Colorado, with inventing flipped learning in 2007 when they started making videos for their students to learn from before coming to class.
They drew inspiration from Sal Khan, an American financial analyst, who in 2004 started tutoring his cousin in Maths over the Internet and was persuaded to record the sessions and share them through YouTube.
In 1997 Harvard University professor, Eric Mazur, published a book called “Peer Instruction,” which shifted the focus in the classroom from transfer of information to assimilation.
In many ways, this was a return to the tutoring model of the West’s oldest universities like Oxford and Cambridge.  Students are expected to learn about a subject privately for 1 week and so that they can discuss it intelligently with their tutor when they meet.
And that, of course, is a model adopted by the ancient tutors of both Greece and China.  If you were not learning on your own, Confucius couldn’t do his job as a Master Teacher: “举一隅，不以三隅反，则不复也。”

Perhaps we should say that flipped learning is using technology to turn learning back the right way up again.
