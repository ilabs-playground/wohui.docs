"Flipped Learning" means that students acquire the information on their own BEFORE the lesson and put it to use under the teacher's direction DURING the lesson.

This is in contrast to the "Traditional" model that we have become used to in schools, where the teacher transfers new information to the students DURING the lesson and they put it to use in practice exercises on their own AFTER the lesson.

"Flipped learning" today is using technology to turn learning back the right way up again.

### Origins of Flipped Learning

Many credit Bergmann and Sams, two science teachers at Woodland Park High School in Colorado, with inventing flipped learning in 2007 when they started making videos for their students to work through before coming to class.

They drew inspiration from Sal Khan, an American financial analyst, who in 2004 started tutoring his cousin in Maths over the Internet and was persuaded to record the sessions and share them through YouTube.

In 1997 Harvard University professor, Eric Mazur, had published a book called “Peer Instruction,” which shifted the focus in the classroom from transfer of information to assimilation.

In many ways, this was a return to the tutoring model of the West’s oldest universities like Oxford and Cambridge.  Students there are expected to read up about a subject for one week prior to their tutorial and so that they can discuss it intelligently with their tutor when they meet.

And that, of course, is a model adopted by the ancient tutors of both Greece and China.  If you did not learn on your own, Confucius could not do his job as a Master Teacher: 举一隅，不以三隅反，则不复也。
