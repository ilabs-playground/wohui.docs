There are 4 roles for people who support the learners on their journeys: 
- **Administrators** manage the system and its USERS
- **Editors** manage the CONTENT
- **Writers** produce the texts that put the content in CONTEXT
- **Teachers** provide personal CONTACT

### CONTENT
![Content](http://dulwich-hk-public.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/help.images/content.png)
There are things the learner needs to know and things they need to be able to do in order to succeed in public examinations and to navigate a Chinese language environment with confidence.  The learner needs to:
- **Know** certain WORDS (in spoken and/or written form) and how to put them together (SENTENCE PATTERNS)
- **Do** certain things, defined in "I can ..." statements (OBJECTIVES)
The content for each course is scoped out and sequenced in SCHEME)

### CONTEXT
![Context](http://dulwich-hk-public.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/help.images/context.png)
In the real world, these words and sentence patterns do not occur in isolation but in a wide variety of contexts.
- SCENARIOS suggest some of these contexts that the learner might conceivably find themselves in. 
- PRODUCTS suggest some of the language that the learner might conceivably need to produce (in spoken or written form) in those scenarios.  Models are provided for the learner as SPEAKING PRODUCT and WRITING PRODUCT.

In addition, the learner may encounter the words and sentence patterns in things that they hear or read.  Again, conceivable examples are provided as LISTENING SCRIPT and READING TEXT.

Where possible these texts are the SOURCES of the content as well as products of it.

### CONTACT

Language is the key tool in human interaction, so the language learning journey needs to be continually rooted in human contact.  Any journey is challenging, so the learner needs human coaching, encouragement, adjustment and practice.  To facilitate this, learners will normally be grouped in CLASSES which meet with each other and one or more teachers in LESSONS.
